# Malware Detection in Android Application

This project focuses on detecting malware in Android applications using machine learning techniques. The aim is to develop a reliable and efficient system that can identify and classify malicious applications to enhance the security of Android devices.    
## Dataset
Dataset for this project is uploaded directly as a file below the Android malware.ipynb code in the name of Dataset.csv you download it there.
Refer to the Android malware.ipynb file for the implementation of these steps.It is available with output below the respective codes.

## Model Training and Testing

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The steps include:

1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
2. Vectorizing the feature set using techniques like TF-IDF for permissions or one-hot encoding for categorical features
3. Building the machine learning model 
4. Training the model on the training setThe trained model can be used to predict whether a given Android application is malicious or benign. The prediction script takes an APK file as input and outputs the classification result.
5. Evaluating the model on the testing set

## Prediction
The trained model can be used to predict whether a given Android application is malicious or benign. The prediction script takes an APK file as input and outputs the classification result.

## Installation
